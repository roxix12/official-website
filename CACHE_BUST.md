# ðŸ”„ CACHE BUSTING DEPLOYMENT

## Issue: Old header showing despite new code deployed

### Problem:
- Authentication system working (Discord/GitHub buttons visible)
- But header still shows old "Sign In" instead of new user dropdown
- Browser/CDN caching old JavaScript files

### Solution:
1. Version bump to force new build
2. Debug logging added to AuthButton  
3. Fresh deployment to clear cache
4. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Deployment: v0.1.1
- Added debug logging to track user state
- Version bumped to force cache invalidation  
- New deployment will have fresh JavaScript bundles

### Expected After Deployment:
- Header will show modern user dropdown when logged in
- "View Profile" option in dropdown
- Professional user management experience
