## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### **Password Special Characters**
Your password `$o[5Pi46L` contains special characters:
- `$` - Dollar sign
- `[` and `]` - Square brackets

These should work fine in environment variables, but if you encounter issues:
1. Try wrapping the password in quotes: `"$o[5Pi46L"`
2. Or escape special characters if needed

### **Security Reminders**
- ‚úÖ Never commit `.env` files to Git
- ‚úÖ The `.env` file is already in `.gitignore`
- ‚úÖ Only use these credentials for your business email
- ‚úÖ Change password if you suspect it's compromised
