DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public read access for images" ON storage.objects;
CREATE POLICY "Public read access for images" 
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT 
TO public 
USING (bucket_id = 'images');

-- Policy 2: Allow authenticated users to UPLOAD images
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can upload images" ON storage.objects;
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload images" 
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT 
TO authenticated 
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'images');

-- Policy 3: Allow authenticated users to UPDATE images
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can update images" ON storage.objects;
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can update images" 
ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE 
TO authenticated 
USING (bucket_id = 'images');

-- Policy 4: Allow authenticated users to DELETE images
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can delete images" ON storage.objects;
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can delete images" 
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE 
TO authenticated 
USING (bucket_id = 'images');
```

### **Step 3: Verify Setup** ‚úÖ

**Run this query to check if everything is working:**

```sql
-- Check if bucket exists
SELECT * FROM storage.buckets WHERE id = 'images';

-- Check if policies exist  
SELECT policyname, cmd 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'storage' AND tablename = 'objects';
```

**Expected result:** 
- 1 bucket named `images`
