# First, run the updated comment moderation SQL
# Open Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor → New Query
# Copy and paste the entire content of UPDATE_COMMENTS_MODERATION.sql
```

### 2. Verify Setup

After running the SQL, verify the setup:

1. Check that `blog_comments` table exists
2. Verify RLS policies are in place
3. Test comment submission on a blog post
4. Check admin panel Comments section

### 3. Test the System

1. **Test Comment Submission:**
   - Go to any blog post
   - Try submitting a comment with a link → Should be blocked
   - Submit a normal comment → Should show pending approval message

2. **Test Admin Panel:**
   - Go to admin panel → Comments
   - See pending comments
   - Approve/reject comments
   - View comment statistics

## 📊 Database Schema

### `blog_comments` Table Structure

```sql
CREATE TABLE public.blog_comments (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    blog_post_id UUID,
    blog_post_slug VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    commenter_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    commenter_email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    comment_text TEXT NOT NULL,
    is_approved BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Key Fields

- `is_approved`: Controls comment visibility (FALSE by default)
- `blog_post_slug`: Links comment to specific blog post
- `comment_text`: The actual comment content
- `created_at`/`updated_at`: Timestamps for tracking

## 🔐 Security Features

### Row Level Security (RLS) Policies

1. **Public Users:**
   - Can only view approved comments
   - Can insert comments (set to pending by default)

2. **Authenticated Admins:**
   - Can view all comments (approved and pending)
   - Can approve/reject comments
   - Can delete comments

### Link Detection Algorithm

The system detects various types of links:

```javascript
// URL patterns detected:
- https://example.com
- http://example.com
- www.example.com
- example.com
- subdomain.example.com
- user@domain.com (email addresses)
```

## 🎛️ Admin Panel Features

### Comments Management Page

Located at `/comments` in the admin panel:

- **Stats Cards**: Total, Approved, Pending comments
- **Filter Options**: All, Pending, Approved
- **Search**: By name, content, or blog post
- **Actions**: Approve, Reject, Delete
- **Link Warning**: Visual indicator for comments containing links

### Dashboard Integration

The main dashboard now shows:
- Total comments count
- Pending comments alert
- Quick stats overview

## 🚀 Usage Guide

### For Users (Blog Visitors)

1. **Submitting Comments:**
   - Fill in name, email, and comment
   - Avoid including any links
   - Click "Post Comment"
   - See confirmation that comment is pending approval

2. **Link Detection:**
   - If you type a link, you'll see a red warning
   - Comment form will show red border
   - Submission will be blocked until links are removed

### For Admins

1. **Managing Comments:**
   - Go to Admin Panel → Comments
   - Review pending comments
   - Click "Approve" to make comments public
   - Click "Delete" to remove inappropriate comments

2. **Monitoring:**
   - Dashboard shows comment statistics
   - Pending comments are highlighted
   - Easy filtering and searching

## 🔧 Configuration

### Customizing Link Detection

To modify what's considered a "link", edit the `containsLinks` function in:
- `src/services/commentsService.js`
- `admin-panel/src/services/commentsService.js`

### Changing Approval Workflow

To auto-approve certain comments, modify the `addComment` function to set `is_approved: true` based on your criteria.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Comments not appearing:**
   - Check if RLS policies are enabled
   - Verify comments are approved in admin panel

2. **Permission errors:**
   - Ensure admin user is authenticated in Supabase
   - Check RLS policies are correctly set

3. **Link detection not working:**
   - Verify `containsLinks` function is imported
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors

### Database Queries for Debugging

```sql
-- Check comment stats
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE is_approved = TRUE) as approved,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE is_approved = FALSE) as pending
FROM blog_comments;

-- View all pending comments
SELECT * FROM blog_comments WHERE is_approved = FALSE;

-- Check RLS policies
SELECT policyname, cmd, roles FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'blog_comments';
```

## 📈 Future Enhancements

Potential improvements you could add:

1. **Email Notifications**: Notify admin when new comments arrive
2. **Comment Threading**: Reply to comments
3. **Spam Detection**: AI-powered spam filtering
4. **User Profiles**: Allow users to edit/delete their own comments
5. **Comment Reactions**: Like/dislike buttons
6. **Bulk Actions**: Approve/delete multiple comments at once
