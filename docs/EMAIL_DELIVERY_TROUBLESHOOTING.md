## 🔍 Why You Might Not Be Receiving Emails

Since emails are sending successfully, the issue is likely delivery-related:

### 1. 📬 **Check Your Email Folders**
- **Primary Inbox**: Look in your main Gmail inbox
- **Spam/Junk Folder**: Gmail might be filtering automated emails
- **Promotions Tab**: Gmail might categorize newsletter emails here
- **Updates Tab**: Sometimes transactional emails go here

### 2. ⏰ **Gmail Delivery Delays**
- **Normal Delay**: 1-5 minutes for Gmail-to-Gmail delivery
- **Peak Times**: Can be 10-15 minutes during high traffic
- **New Sender**: Gmail might delay emails from new automated systems
- **Learning Period**: Gmail's spam filter is still learning your patterns

### 3. 🛡️ **Gmail Spam Filtering**
Gmail is very aggressive with automated emails:
- **New Domain**: Your system is new, so Gmail is cautious
- **Content Triggers**: Certain words might trigger spam filters
- **Volume**: Multiple test emails might look suspicious
- **Authentication**: Gmail prefers emails with proper SPF/DKIM records

### 4. 🔧 **Email Client Issues**
- **Sync Delays**: Email clients may not sync immediately
- **Filter Rules**: You might have filters automatically moving emails
- **Storage Full**: Insufficient storage can block new emails
- **Offline Mode**: Email client might be offline
